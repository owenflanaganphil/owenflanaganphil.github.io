## Philosophy as a Living Practice.
I believe that education is not merely a preparation for life but life itself. I hope that students do not just memorize certain facts about what happened in the history of philosophy, but are able to apply the ethical considerations learned in the classroom in their daily lives. I emphasize projects-based learning rather than exams-based learning where students can build something of their own and I give them the freedom to present on non-traditional media. Theyâ€™re encouraged to do their projects not as an academic paper but as a video demonstration or a website or even a game. I value creativity and I want to cultivate skills that are useful to my students outside of the classroom. Given the broad spectrum of what philosophy can be, my Introduction to Philosophy course and my Philosophy of Games course are perfect test grounds for these innovative ways of teaching and learning.
## Enhancement of Communication Skills.
