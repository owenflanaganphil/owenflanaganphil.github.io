            <h2>Philosophy as a Living Practice</h2>
            <p>I believe that education is not merely a preparation for life but life itself. I hope that students do not just memorize 
                certain facts about what happened in the history of philosophy, but are able to apply the ethical considerations learned 
                in the classroom in their daily lives. I emphasize projects-based learning rather than exams-based learning where students 
                can build something of their own and I give them the freedom to present on non-traditional media. They’re encouraged to do 
                their projects not as an academic paper but as a video demonstration or a website or even a game. I value creativity and I 
                want to cultivate skills that are useful to my students outside of the classroom. Given the broad spectrum of what philosophy
                can be, my Introduction to Philosophy course and my <a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">Philosophy of Games course</a>
                Philosophy of Games course are perfect test grounds for these innovative 
                ways of teaching and learning.

            <h2> Enhancement of Communication Skills. </h2>
            <p>I believe that the ability to communicate effectively—whether through writing, speaking, or active listening—is essential for both academic success and personal development. Philosophy, with its emphasis on clear argumentation, critical thinking, and the articulation of complex ideas, provides an ideal framework for cultivating these skills in students. In my class, students have plenty of opportunities to do presentations and group presentations. They are encouraged to teach each other a certain philosophical argument by finding examples that they find appealing rather than being only given examples by me.

            <h2> Incorporating Diverse Philosophical Traditions. </h2>
            <p> I want to provide an opportunity to broaden students’ exposure to non-Western perspectives. In my courses, I integrate texts and ideas from a variety of philosophical traditions, encouraging students to appreciate the richness and diversity of philosophical inquiry. When teaching Chinese philosophy, I highlight the ways in which Confucian, Daoist, and Buddhist thought address ethical, metaphysical, and epistemological issues, often in ways that differ significantly from Western approaches. This comparative approach not only enriches students’ understanding of philosophy but also fosters cultural sensitivity and a more global perspective.

            <h2> Promoting Critical Thinking and Dialogue </h2>
            <p> In my classes, I encourage students to critically assess the strengths and weaknesses of different philosophical positions and to develop their own views. To facilitate this, I create a classroom environment where respectful debate and diverse perspectives are valued. I often use small group discussions, Socratic questioning, and peer-review exercises to help students articulate and refine their ideas. In my symbolic logic course, for example, I use collaborative problem-solving sessions to help students develop a deep understanding of formal systems and their applications.
