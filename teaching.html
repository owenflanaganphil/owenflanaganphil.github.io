## Philosophy as a Living Practice.
I believe that education is not merely a preparation for life but life itself. I hope that students do not just memorize certain facts about what happened in the history of philosophy, but are able to apply the ethical considerations learned in the classroom in their daily lives. I emphasize projects-based learning rather than exams-based learning where students can build something of their own and I give them the freedom to present on non-traditional media. They’re encouraged to do their projects not as an academic paper but as a video demonstration or a website or even a game. I value creativity and I want to cultivate skills that are useful to my students outside of the classroom. Given the broad spectrum of what philosophy can be, my Introduction to Philosophy course and my Philosophy of Games course are perfect test grounds for these innovative ways of teaching and learning.

## Enhancement of Communication Skills.
I believe that the ability to communicate effectively—whether through writing, speaking, or active listening—is essential for both academic success and personal development. Philosophy, with its emphasis on clear argumentation, critical thinking, and the articulation of complex ideas, provides an ideal framework for cultivating these skills in students. In my class, students have plenty of opportunities to do presentations and group presentations. They are encouraged to teach each other a certain philosophical argument by finding examples that they find appealing rather than being only given examples by me.
