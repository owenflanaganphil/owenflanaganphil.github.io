<p>Yuan Dong is a PhD candidate at the philosophy department of Duke University. She is primarily
interested in virtue epistemology, social and formal epistemology, and Chinese philosophy. She’s
currently researching the philosophy of trust from a diverse set of perspectives and
methodologies. On the Chinese philosophy side, she argues that the Xunzian xin (trust) is a
complex virtue that involves both a moral and an epistemic dimension. She also aims to model
trusting behaviors in epistemic communities using agent-based modeling (ABM). On the more
applied side of things, Yuan wants to apply her accounts of trust to trusting relationships
between humans and artificial agents such as AI. As VR and AI technology continues to advance,
understanding the nuances of trusting relationships with virtual agents becomes increasingly
important for designing ethically sensitive, responsible, helpful, and effective AIs that enhance 
user experience and well-being.</p>
